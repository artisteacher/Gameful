# Gameful: A fork of the Game-On Project

Game-On (GO) is an educational framework that provides teachers with a vast amount of tools to create their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification" target="_blank">gamified</a> learning system.

### Important note on development dependency
<<<<<<< HEAD
This fork of the Game-On project is dependent on several open source libraries and plugins. They have been seamlessly included where possible.  One important exception is Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Pro. This plugin is required for the Gameful to work in both development and production environments. It is not included in this repository because it is a paid subscription plugin. If you wish to develop this plugin, you can purchase a copy of the complete plugin including all dependencies at http://gameful.me, or include your own copy of ACF Pro in the /includes/acf directory. Do not install ACF normally because there are conditionals in the Gameful code that load the plugin as needed.

Developers may also request to fork the private branch of the plugin that contains the dependencies.

### Installation Requirements

Make sure to talk to your web hosting service provider about these technical requirements, if you have any doubts.

#### PHP

Make sure that your hosting service supports and maintains a PHP version of **at least** `7.0`. Ideally, every service would have updated their PHP versions to `7.1`, but that isn't a realistic assumption. 

If your service does not provide a version of PHP greater than `7.0`, please be aware that there are potential compatibility issues due to the nature of the outdated software.

#### WordPress

We highly recommend keeping your WordPress installation up to date. This not only ensures that you receive all official [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) security updates and hotfixes, but you'll also receive the best experience when using GO.
