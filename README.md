# Gameful: A fork of the Game-On Project

Game-On (GO) is an educational framework that provides teachers with a vast amount of tools to create their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification" target="_blank">gamified</a> learning system.

###Gameful.me--a new way to get your game on!

If you are looking for the easiest way to use this plugin check out <a href="https://gameful.me">Gameful.me</a>.
It is a managed hosting specifically for the game-on plugin. There are tools to help you migrate your existing game to the the gameful.me system. 

#####If you are new to game on we highly recommend using gameful.me instead of hosting the plugin yourself. We will be focused on development and support for the new project.

### Installation Requirements

Make sure to talk to your web hosting service provider about these technical requirements, if you have any doubts.

#### PHP

Make sure that your hosting service supports and maintains a PHP version of **at least** `7.0`. 
#### WordPress

We highly recommend keeping your WordPress installation up to date. This not only ensures that you receive all official [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) security updates and hotfixes, but you'll also receive the best experience when using GO.

#### Other Concerns

Often times shared hosting isn't ideal for hosting Game On. Hosts often put limits on the servers for security reasons that impact Game On.  One student doing multiple failed logins can look like a dns attack resulting in your host blocking your IP--and all of your students.
